# Severance: Secure SPARQL Service

# Installing the Internal Component

## Prerequisites

1. A GraphDB instance up and running, containing...
2. A repository (called e.g. 'severance'), containing...
3. Patient Registry data following the CARE-SM model
4. A read-only user on the 'severance' repository (e.g. username/pass 'suser'/'spass')
5. An instance of Severence External running in your DMZ, and
6. It's API URL must be visible from THIS SERVER to reach-out

## Configuration

1. **Start with an empty folder**, and (as you, not as root) create a subfolder `./queries`
2. Make a copy of the env_template file to and edit it 
3. save it as `.env`
4. create a docker-compose.yml as instructed below 

### env_template

    # must be the same key as the External component!
    ENCRYPTION_KEY_HEX=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
    RESULT_FORMAT=csv  # must be the same as the External component!
    QUERY_DIR=/queries  # DO NOT CHANGE THIS unless you really know what you're doing
    EXTERNAL_URL=http://111.111.111.111:3000   # The URL to the External API.  
    TRIPLESTORE_URL=http://localhost:7200/repositories/MyREPO  # make sure you create the readonly user
    TRIPLESTORE_USER = markw
    TRIPLESTORE_PASS = markw
    POLL_INTERVAL=10  # seconds
    UID=1000   #  at terminal:   id -u
    GID=1000   # at terminal:  id -g

The `ENCRYPTION_KEY_HEX` must be shared with the external componenet, since all results are encrypted

write this to `.env` after editing.  UID and GID ensure that you have access to modify the `./queries` folder.

Test your access to the external URL by calling, e.g. `http://111.111.111.111:3000/severance`  You will either get a message or an "Unauthorized" response.  Any other kind of error means you cannot see the server from here.

### docker-compose.yml

For security, this container runs with the permissions of the user who you declare in the .env as the user who will be starting this container.

NEVER START IT AS ROOT!!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

UID AND GID MUST BE CORRECT!  See instructions in the env_template and below for how to know that
**You must get the permissions correct, or the container will not run properly, if at all.**  

Take a moment and figure out your UID and GID!  It defaults to 1000/1000, which is the first non-root user that is created on a system... but that is just a very bad guess.  Take a moment and get it right!

The setting `network mode: host` is critical!  The internal code inside of the docker container must be able to "see" the external component, just as you did when you tested it in the last step.  Please do not change that.

    services:
    internal:
        network_mode: host
        image: XXXXX  (the docker-compose in the example, it points to the latest patch)        env_file: .env
        volumes:
        - "./queries:/queries"
        tmpfs:
        - /tmp:size=64m,noexec,nosuid,nodev
        environment:
        - TMPDIR=/tmp
        - UID=${UID:-1000}   #the output of  id -u at the terminal, set in .env
        - GID=${GID:-1000}   #the output of  id -g at the terminal, set in .env
        user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"   # Run container as your host user, or 1000 fallback (which is usually the first non-root user created on a Linux system)  
        


### Start 

**You should not start Internal until you have installed and tested External**.  You will need to do some testing on External that will be interrupted by the polling from Internal.

`docker-compose up -d`


## QUERIES

In the `./queries` folder there are some examples of annotated queries that can be interpreted by Severance Internal.  If you modify these, your changes will be preserved from one compose-down/up to another.  If you need to fully reset, delete the content of the `./queries` folder and it will be re-populated with the example queries the next time you start.

We provide some [guidance for how to author these queries](./queries/README.md) so that they can be interpreted by Severance and used to build a sensible UI on the External side, and also to help them be more universally discoverable based on their Query Type.

**Note:**  The ./queries folder content is re-read every time Internal polls External, so you can dynamically change the queries in that folder and it will update on the next polling cycle.
